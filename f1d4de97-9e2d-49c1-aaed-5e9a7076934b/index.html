Later in this letter, discussing the French Revolution, Schiller writes: ``As this great action, because of its content and its consequences, so closely concerns everyone who calls himself a man, so much must it, because of its mode of discussion, especially interest every self-thinker. A question which would otherwise only be answered through the blind right of the stronger, is now, as it seems, made to pend before the tribunal of pure reason, and only he, who is always able to place himself in the center of the whole and to raise his individuality to that of the species, may regard himself as a member of that tribunal of reason, at the same time as he, as man and world citizen, is party and sees himself more nearly or distantly involved in the outcome.'' </p><p> Schiller develops this thought further in the fourth letter, where he states that ``every individual man, one can say, carries by predisposition and destiny, a purely ideal man within himself, to agree with whose immutable unity in all his alterations is the great task of his existence.'' Later in this letter he states:</p><p>      ``With an entirely different respect, than is that which the artist of beauty shows his material, must the artist of the state approach that of his, and he must not merely subjectively and for an illusory effect on the senses, but rather objectively, and for the inner essence, spare its peculiarity and personality.
``</p><p>But for just this reason, because the state should be an organization which forms itself through itself and for itself, so can it also only in so far become real, as the parts have raised themselves to the idea of the whole. Because the state serves as representative of pure and objective humanity in the breast of its citizens, so will it have to observe the same relationship towards its citizens, in which they stand to themselves, and also only be able to respect their subjective humanity to that degree, that it is ennobled to the objective. When the inner man is one with himself, so will he even in the highest universalization of his conduct save his individuality, and the state will be merely the interpreter of his beautiful instincts, the more distinct formula of his inner legislation.''</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
