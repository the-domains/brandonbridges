"With malice toward none...(and)...charity for all. With firmness in...(what is good)... as... (infinite)... gives us to see...(what is good)... Let us strive on to finish the work we are in. To bind up...(our)...wounds. To care for... (they)...who have borne the battle and for...(those who depended on they)...to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all..." -Abraham Lincoln
