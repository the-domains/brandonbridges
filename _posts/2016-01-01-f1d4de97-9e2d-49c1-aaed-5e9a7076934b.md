While there seems to be today an unbridgeable gap between so-called art, and politics and science, Friedrich Schiller fought against the \`\`Zerissenheit seiner Zeit'' (the torn-apart condition of his time) and tried to reunite the inner man with himself.   
In his essay, \`\`Theater Considered as a Moral Institution,'' (whose original title was \`\`Was eine gute Schaub√ºhne bewirken kann''--\`\`What a Good Theater Can Accomplish''), Schiller writes that he uses his dramas to \`\`make man known to man and to unveil the secret movements according to which he acts.'' 

In his letters about his drama Don Carlos, Schiller describes his political ideas: \`\`Recall dear friend, a certain discussion, about a favorite subject of our decade--about the spreading of a purer, gentler humanity, about the highest possible freedom of the individual within the state's highest bloom, in short, about the most perfect condition of man, as it lies given as achievable in his nature and his powers.'' 

In his \`\`Letters On the Aesthetical Education of Man,'' Schiller says, in the second letter, that the \`\`philosophical spirit of inquiry is invited so forcibly by the circumstances of the time, to engage itself with the most perfect of all works of art, with the construction of a true political freedom.'' Later in this letter, discussing the French Revolution, Schiller writes: \`\`As this great action, because of its content and its consequences, so closely concerns everyone who calls himself a man, so much must it, because of its mode of discussion, especially interest every self-thinker. A question which would otherwise only be answered through the blind right of the stronger, is now, as it seems, made to pend before the tribunal of pure reason, and only he, who is always able to place himself in the center of the whole and to raise his individuality to that of the species, may regard himself as a member of that tribunal of reason, at the same time as he, as man and world citizen, is party and sees himself more nearly or distantly involved in the outcome.'' 

Schiller develops this thought further in the fourth letter, where he states that \`\`every individual man, one can say, carries by predisposition and destiny, a purely ideal man within himself, to agree with whose immutable unity in all his alterations is the great task of his existence.'' Later in this letter he states:

\`\`With an entirely different respect, than is that which the artist of beauty shows his material, must the artist of the state approach that of his, and he must not merely subjectively and for an illusory effect on the senses, but rather objectively, and for the inner essence, spare its peculiarity and personality.
\`\`

But for just this reason, because the state should be an organization which forms itself through itself and for itself, so can it also only in so far become real, as the parts have raised themselves to the idea of the whole. Because the state serves as representative of pure and objective humanity in the breast of its citizens, so will it have to observe the same relationship towards its citizens, in which they stand to themselves, and also only be able to respect their subjective humanity to that degree, that it is ennobled to the objective. When the inner man is one with himself, so will he even in the highest universalization of his conduct save his individuality, and the state will be merely the interpreter of his beautiful instincts, the more distinct formula of his inner legislation.''
